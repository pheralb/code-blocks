> [**Code-Blocks**](https://code-blocks.pheralb.dev) separates components and utilities. You can use them independently.

## Styling

All components uses [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for styling. Make sure to have it installed and configured in your project.

For some colors, we use [**neutral** theme](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/colors) from Tailwind CSS:

<DocNeutralColors />

## Components

> If you're using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), you can skip this section as the required dependencies are already included.

1. Create a new React app:

<CreateReactApp />

2. Install the following dependencies:

<CodeBlockSelectPkg
  type="install"
  title="Required Dependencies"
  command="clsx tailwind-merge lucide-react @react-symbols/icons"
/>

3. Create the `cn` utility:

```ts title="src/utils/cn.ts"
import { clsx, type ClassValue } from "clsx";
import { twMerge } from "tailwind-merge";

export function cn(...inputs: ClassValue[]) {
  return twMerge(clsx(inputs));
}
```

## Utilities

All the utilities are built using TypeScript. You'll only need install the highlighter library you choose to use:

<HighlightsAvailable />
